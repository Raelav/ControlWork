Control work on the OOP.
In this work, in addition to the basic tasks, I tried to implement the “Factory Method” design pattern.

Task 1 (ComplexNumber) : Define a class for complex numbers.

Task 2 (RationalFraction): Determine the class of fractions - rational numbers, which are the ratio of two integers
numbers.

Task 3 (Date) : Create Date Class.

Task 4 (Polynomial) : Create a class for storing polynomials.

Task 5 (NDimensionalVector) : Create a class that allows you to store vectors in n-dimensional space.

Task 6 (MailingAddress) : Create a class that allows you to store information about the postal address of the organization.,
including the name of the organization, full address, postal code.

Task 7 (ThreeDVector) : Create a class to store three-dimensional vectors.

Task 8 (ChainList) : Create a class to store chained lists of strings (strings of arbitrary length).

Task 9 (OneDArray) : Create a class to store one-dimensional arrays of integers (vectors).

Task 10 (MessageLog) : Create a class to store messages in logs.

Task 11 (OneDStringArray) : Create a class to store one-dimensional arrays of fixed-length strings.

Task 12 (TriangleABC) : Create a class to hold triangles.

Task 13 (PlayingCard) : Create a class to store the card, with suit and rank.  

Task 14 (SquareMatrix) : Create a class to store square matrices.

Task 15 (Rectangle) : Create a class of rectangles with sides parallel to the axes.

Task 16 (Counter) : A digital counter is a variable with a limited range that is reset,
when its integer value reaches a certain maximum.
